# Plugins List

This is a simple Wordpress plugin aimed at giving credit where credit is due.

The plugin inserts an XHTML list into any post/page through a shortcode. If you're into customization, you can specify a format argument and indicate the exact output you are after. There's also an option to display inactive plugins as well.

Features include...

* A simple template system allows you to format how you'd like the plugin information to be shown
* Template tags are available for automatically linked items as well as simple text
* Choose from a number of pieces of plugin data to be output
* Display inactive plugins as well as active plugins if you wish
* Output is cached to provide a super-quick response
* A separate shortcode allows you to display how many plugins you have!
